  #push [[What is the Agora]]?
  <ul>
    <li>
      I've been wanting to write a special node which acts as explainer to the
      Agora that should be accessible to the average (?) internet browser, in
      the sense of a person browsing the internet.
    </li>
    <li>
      Node [[agora]] was maybe originally that but it has amassed a lot of
      historical content which makes it harder to offer a 'curated' primer
      experience.
    </li>
    <li>
      I've also been thinking about this as a [[WTF]] button which we could
      render in red up top, with the milder tooltip 'I don't understand / what
      is this place anyway?'
    </li>
    <li>
      Surely writing this would be an interesting challenge in the first place
      :) The Agora is many things, at least to me, and probably to all the
      people already in the Agora of Flancia; and it has accreted layers
      (meanings) as time goes by.
    </li>
  </ul>
